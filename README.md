# A cookbook for deploying NixOS to cloud servers

* [Part 1](/part1) provides a way to deploy NixOS
  to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
  by building a custom NixOS disk image.
  It also introduces remote management of your cloud servers
  using [Morph](https://github.com/DBCDK/morph)
  and uses this to deploy an instance of nginx HTTP server.
